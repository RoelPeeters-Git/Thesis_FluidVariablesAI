# Fluid_variables_AI
Master's Thesis project to obtain and predict fluid variables by use of AI

The code is being used as a basis of the research performed in my Master's Thesis.

First a simple implementation of a neural network is tested. 
This is to understand the specifics and mathematics behind current neural networks.

Second stage is the use of Tensorflow to create models that can predict Force coëfficiënt values
on a cilinder in an airstream.
